# pre-requisite
1. IDE, i am using Visual studio code which can be downloaded in this link https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Qwen Model - you can go to use offline version from Qwen official repo https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen or for my simplicity i am just using Model As a service (MaaS) from alibaba cloud portal which you can register in here https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/product/modelstudio?_p_lc=1 (you can use free trial version and try many Qwen model inside)
3. Once you register you are able to create API KEY which needed in some of the code in this repo.
